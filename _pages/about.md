Buna/Welcome! My name is Mirela Bivol, My journey began with me putting myself out there, and from that experience I learnt that it is through adversity that we develop the most. I began grooming dogs at the age of 18, and after three years I decided to branch out and put myself in uncomfortable situations. This allowed me to go outside my comfort zone and discover my love for diverse, interdisciplinary skills and understandings. Today, I am proud to say that in addition to being a dog lover and groomer, I am also expanding my knowledge in interdisciplinary studies, with an emphasis on global and intercultural understanding.

## Background
When I was three, My family and I moved to Washington State from Balti, Moldova. Growing up, I had a pet chicken, her name was billy, but I only had a dog when I was 19 years old. That's when I got my first fur baby named Manuela. Her brother droopy joined the family a year later when I met his owner, my now husband. Having two dogs has been the best thing ever. I have worked with dogs for about 5 years while pursuing further education at the University of Arizona.
